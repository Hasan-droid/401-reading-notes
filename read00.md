## <a name="1"></a>How to Solve Programming Problems

<p><span style="color:red"><b> "Measure twice and cut once" </b></span></p>

> Don't start coding directly, take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it

> Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy


### **Follow these simple set of steps:**  
  
1- Read the problem completely twice  
Warning !!! >>>> this is the most important step.  

2- Solve the problem manually  
when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  

3- Optimize the manual solution  
figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.  

4- Write pseudo-code or comments  
capture all the steps created before and put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.  

5- Replace comments with real code   
If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

* You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
* You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion


> **In any language, you should know how to do the following things:**
> 
> * Create a list  
>* Sort a list or array  
>* Create a map or dictionary  
>* Loop through a list, or dictionary  
>* Parse strings  
>* Convert from string to int, int to string, etc  
>
>*If you don’t know how to do all of these things,  Stop what you are doing now and learn them.*  

6-  Optimize the real code

## <a name="2"></a>Act like you make $1000/hr  

What would your life look like?  
What people would you stop putting up with?  
What problems would you stop wasting time on?  
What things would you stop — and start — doing?  

> “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”__*Jeff Goins*

 ***Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy***  
 For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.  



 > Cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do.

 Successful people don’t tolerate busywork or distraction, They have crystal clear vision on their goals, and do what they need to do to get there, every single day.

> “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are.”__*Steve Jobs*

## <a name="3"></a>How to think like a programmer   

**Have a framework**  

1. Understand  
to ensure that you understand the problem explain it in simple language, write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (use the rubber dock).

2. Plan  
write down the exact steps (use comments).


3. Divide  
Do not try to solve one big problem, break it into sub-problems, then, solve each sub-problem one by one, then connect the dots between sub-solutions.

> This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving.

4. Stuck?  
*The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.*

***...to overcome that:***  
* Debug  
Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
* Reassess  
Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.  
*or*  
Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.

* Research  
No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it.Find that person/ solution.   


5. Practice  
Practice. Practice. Practice...   
*and*   
Practice. Practice. Practice...  

 >***solve a lot of problems!***  
 Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….

## <a name="4"></a>5 Whys  

when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.  


***How to use ...***

1. Assemble a Team  target  
contact with people have the same problem.  
2. Define the Problem  
observe the problem in action, and Discuss it.  
3. Ask the First "Why?"  
don't guess why that happens, search about it.  
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times  
connect the answers 
5. Know When to Stop  
when the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further.  
6. Address the Root Causes  
identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.  
7. Monitor Your Measures  
watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely.
