## Review

**Describe “The Cloud”**  
 servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

**What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**  
standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

**What is auto-scaling?**  
lets us build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand.

**What is bandwidth?**  
the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.

**How do cloud providers compute service costs?**  
can charge on a per-hour, per-minute, or per-second basis

> CDN

- Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
- CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request.
- . The main reasons why company want to use CDNs are to improve Internet website load speeds, content delivery speeds, and to reduce the likelihood of falling victim to and improve defenses against Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).
